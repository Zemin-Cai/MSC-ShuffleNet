This repository contains the source code for the following paper.  
Zemin Cai, Jiarui Luo "MSC-ShuffleNet: an efficient design for medical image segmentation on portable devices,"

## Requirements
The code has been tested on PyTorch 1.10.2 and Cuda 11.7.  


## Training
After you have the 'train.py' code for the project, run the file for training. However, before doing that, make sure that the training dataset is prepared.  


## Evaluation
You can use the 'val.py' code in the project to evaluate a pre-trained model. The pre-trained weights can be found in the 'models' folder.
