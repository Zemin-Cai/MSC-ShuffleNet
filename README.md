## Requirements
The code has been tested on PyTorch 1.10.2 and Cuda 11.7.  


## Training
After obtaining the "train.py" code for the project, run the file to train the model. However, before doing so, ensure that the training dataset is prepared.  


## Evaluation
You can utilize the "val.py" code within the project to assess a pre-trained model. The pre-trained weights can be located in the "models" folder.
